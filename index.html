						<span><strong>Hi I'm Kati, </strong></span>former student 
						of Health Science, future student of Computer Science, and current obsessed Code-Newbie. My CS curiosity started to develop in early January 2015 when I enrolled in my first Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), HarvardX&rsquo;s CS50: Introduction to Computer Science, through EdX. There I was introduced to Scratch and developed my first game, Magic Space Donut. Enter full-blown coding obsession. 
						I started learning as much as I could, from wherever I could best learn it, as fast as possible. Codecademy quickly became my go-to, where I began to learn about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Python. I also took a MOOC by the University of Michigan on Python, called Intro to Programming. When shortly thereafter I came across the A100 apprenticeship program, I set out to do whatever it took to be able to be a part of it and was able to pass my coding challenge with Python.  As an A100 pre-apprentice, I was able to dive head-first into the world of Meteor, MongoDB, Git and GitHub, along with Agile Development Methodology. I also had the opportunity to learn about paired-programming and develop my presentation skills by delivering presentations on my weekly JavaScript epiphanies. I&rsquo;m now working on continuing my learning of JavaScript, Meteor, and MongoDB through a new set of MOOC&rsquo;s from the University of London called Responsive Website Development and Design Specialization where specifically, I&rsquo;m currently taking the following three courses: 
							<ul>
								<li>1. 	Responsive Website Basics: Code with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,</li>
								<li>2. 	Responsive Web Design, and</li>
								<li>3. 	Introduction to Meteor.js Development.</li>
							</ul>
						I&rsquo;m also working through the Challenge Map at freecodecamp, having completed the HTML5 and CSS, Responsive Design with Bootstrap, and jQuery challenges of the Front End Development Certification. 
						My plan moving forward is to:
							<ul>
								<li>1. 	Complete the Front End Development Certification with Basic JavaScript, Object Oriented and Functional Programming, Algorithm Scripting, JSON APIs and Ajax, as well as completing 300 hours of Front End Development Projects,</li>
								<li>2. 	Apply to become a full Apprentice for A100&rsquo;s New Haven Summer 2016 cohort, and </li>
								<li>3. 	Dive into the world of Java and work specifically toward applying for an internship with Core Informatics.</li>
							</ul>
